# OpenA3XX 3D Models
Welcome to the public repo for all of our 3D models.

## 3D Printing & CNC Milling
Each element will contain the relevant files for each method of manufacture.

## Folder Structure
For which ever element you are looking for, follow the folder directory to reach it.    
First start with the area of the flight deck the element is.    
E.g. For the MCDU, it is located in the pedestal, so navigate to that directory, and then to the MCDU directory.    
You will then see a folder for 3D printing or CNC milling, choose your method of choice.    
(In some cases, there may be combination options. Such as the MCDU having the option to use both 3D printing and CNC milling)    

## Instructions & Guides
Please take note of the relevant instructions and guides for the elements. You may well find some very useful information which will help with a successful manufacture, avoiding the need to redo in case of a mistake.

We have spent quite a lot of time in protyping these elements, and have made the mistakes so you don't have too!

## Questions?
Feel free to contact us on the Discord server should you have any questions or problems with the elements.
